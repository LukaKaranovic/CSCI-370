Multiway search tree
(a, b) tree
B tree if a ~= b/2
B+ tree if internal node of B tree stores no data
- internal node: search key values & child pointers
- leaf node: 

we want to use B+ tree indexing in databases because 

want to make a node occupy full capacity of a data page.

example:
Student:
sno - 9 bytes
name, email, dob - 80 bytes


Full:
- each node can have maximum b search keys and b+1 child pointers
Half Full (except root):
- minimum a ~= b/2 search keys, a + 1 child pointers

a is the height of the tree
b is determined by search key size

for sno,
page size: 4k
4k ~= 9 * b + (8 * (b+1)

B+ Tree Indexing 
- Primary, clustered, sparse index 
	- internal nodes contain search keys + child pointers
	- leaf nodes contain data pages of tuples
	- all tuples in table are in leaf nodes
- secondary, unclustered, dense index 
	- leaf nodes contain \<search key of tuple, data tuple pointer>
		- data tuple pointer is (page number, tuple number in page)

each tuple is 80 bytes
4k / 80 bytes = 50 tuples per page

i think lecture i gonna be done early

hash table indexing
- calculate search key's hash code
- have big hash table to search for tuples by address
