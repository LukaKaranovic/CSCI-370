## Existential Queries
**Query:** List the name of each employee who worked on project 10001.

**Interpretation:** if and only if there exists a record showing an employee ever worked on project 10001, then this employee’s name should be in the result.

**SQL:**
```sql
select distinct firstname, lastname
from Emps natural join WorksOn
where pno = 10001
```

**Query:** List the name of each employee who NEVER worked on project 10001.

**Interpretation:** if there exists a record showing an employee ever worked on project 10001, then this employee’s name should NOT be in the result.

This is **tuple-level negation**, which isn't enough here! What we need to do is create a table of all employees who have worked on project 10001, and use **table-level negation** to get rid of them!

### Exists
`exists (sub_query)`
* Is a predicate and a Boolean expression
* Does a sub query, and based on results of it returns true or false.
	* Empty table is false
	* Table with tuples of data is true
```sql
select fname, lname
from Students S
where exists (select *
			from Records R
			where R.sno = S.sno
			and R.cid = 'csci');
-- Returns true if the exists sub query table is not empty.
-- No need for 'distinct' because we only look through each tuple in Students once.
```
Since it does return a Boolean value, it's common to have an exists sub query in the where clause.

Exists correlates the outer query and the inner query:
* In the above example, SQL will go through each tuple in the Students table, grab the sno, and check if it exists in a tuple in the Records table where R.cid = 'csci' also. 
* Once it finds one tuple that satisfies those conditions for the sno, exists returns true and selects the fname and lname of that student (with sno).
* Then goes to the next tuple in the Students table.
### In
`<column> IN (set_sub_query)`
```sql
select fname, lname
from Students
where sno IN (select sno
			from records R
			where cid = 'csci');
-- Since the sub query is a set sub query, we won't get duplicates from that sub query.
```
### Pros and Cons of Natural Join, Exists, and In
Natural Join:
- have to apply `distinct`
* remove duplicate typically means sorting, then removing data (expensive operation)
Exists
* No need to do remove duplicate operation
* Complexity is **multiplicative** (for each record in table A, check all of table B)
In
* No need to do remove duplicate operation
* Complexity is **additive** (go through table A, make temp table C that likely fits into main memory, go through table C and extract from table B)
### Negations
List the name of each student who has taken at least one non-csci course; 
* This is a tuple-level negation, so the negation is reflected in the `where` statement Boolean.
```sql
select distinct fname, lname
from Students natural join Records
where cid <> 'csci';
```

If we were to put the keyword `not` in front of the `exists` or `in` statements, it would be a table-level negation and the true/false output would be negated.
```sql
select fname, lname
from Students S
where not exists (select *
			from records R
			where R.sno = S.sno
			and R.cid = 'csci');
-- Returns false if the exists sub query table is not empty.
-- Returns true if the exists sub query table is empty.
```

List the name of each student who has never taken at least one csci course; 
* Get all the names from all students: set1
* Get all the names from all students who have taken a 'csci' course: set2
* Do a set difference: set1 - set2

**Union-compatible:** two or more queries must have the same structure and can be combined using the UNION operation. 
* Each query must return the same number of columns.
* The columns from each query must have compatible data types.
## Oracle Set Operations
**Set Difference** - use keyword `minus`
**Set Union** - removes duplicates
- `union all` doesn't remove duplicates in the set union.
```sql
select 'fname||', '||lname'
from Students
union all
select title
from Courses.
```
The result (assuming Students and Courses only had one column each):

#### Datalog Negations
Result(s) ::= not Student(\_, \_, s, \_, \_)
* Any last name possible not already in Student table
For any top variable, it must be bounded by a positive predicate atom.

## Comparing against a set of values
**Query:** List the name of the employee(s) who has the highest salary:
```sql
select firstname, lastname 
from Emps 
where salary >= all (select salary from Emps);
```
**Query:** List the name of the employee(s) whose salary is not the lowest:
```sql
select firstname, lastname 
from Emps 
where salary > some (select salary from Emps);
```
 `<col_name> <operator> all (sub_query)` - compare with all values from sub query
 * like a 'for all' quantifier
 `<col_name> <operator> some (sub_query)` - compare with some values from sub query
 * like a 'there exists' quantifier
```sql
select s.sno, s.lname, s.fname
from (select max(dob) as maxDate
	  from Students) x, 
	  Students S
where S.dob = x.maxDate;
```

```sql
select sno, fname, lname
from Students
where dob >= 
	all (select dob
		from Students);
-- gets the youngest student
```
## NULL Values
`null` is a special sentinel value to indicate a data item doesn’t exist in the database 
* it usually means one of the following two things: 
	* not applicable, such as the `spouse_name` column for an employee who is still single 
	* we don’t know, such as the `spouse_name` column for an employee who is married but doesn’t want to disclose his/her partner’s name 
* to determine whether a column is null, we must use the special operator `is null` or `is not null`
* the usual comparison operators against a null value will ALWAYS return false. “null = null” is false in database.
## Outer Joins
In inner joins, unmatched rows will be removed from the result.

There are three types of outer joins:
* Left join: unmatched rows from only the left table will be kept in the result.
* Right join: unmatched rows from only the right table will be kept in the result.
* Full outer join: unmatched rows from both the left and the right tables will be kept in the result.
Any unfilled/unmatched columns will be filled with NULL values.
![[Pasted image 20250218145656.png]]
Ex: If unmatched rows from the left table are put into the table, the right table columns would be filled with `NULL`.

![[Pasted image 20250218145845.png]]
A full outer join is like doing both a left and a right outer join at once.

Note: Default `join` means inner join, default `full join` means “full outer join”.
## Where the Subquery is
**Subquery in select clause:** Makes a new column out of the subquery result
![[Pasted image 20250221131512.png]]

**Subquery in from clause:** Subquery is executed first and generates a table, then outer query is executed on that generated table.
* This is a great way to get an aggregate of an aggregate.
![[Pasted image 20250221131746.png]]

**Subquery in where clause:** Functions similar to a join, where we can use a subquery from a different table in a main query.
![[Pasted image 20250221132117.png]]
* Should be `lower(firstname) like '%a%'`
