# Anomalies
## Transactions
A transaction consists one or multiple queries and/or updates that can be translated to a sequence of requests to **read/write operations** on physical objects in the database. A transaction usually means that the data in the database has changed. 
- One of the major uses of DBMS is to **protect the user data from system failures.** It is done by ensuring that all the **data is restored to a consistent state** when the computer is **restarted after a crash.**

Each transaction terminates in one of the two ways:
- **Commit** (keep all the change(s) made by this transaction) 
- **Abort/rollback** (erase any change made earlier by this transaction, as if it never happened in the first place)

Goals of transaction management: 
- **concurrent access/execution** of transactions 
- guarantee **data integrity** (consistent data only in the database)
Assumptions:
- there is a **fixed set** of database objects (for now)
	- database objects:
		- tables/relations
		- physical pages
		- tuples/records
		- attribute of tuple
		- files
	- The real assumption here is that there is a **fixed set** of these objects.
- all transactions access a **single copy** of data (only one database)
- transactions are always correct
	- transaction will leave the database in a **consistent state** (before transaction starts and after it completes)
		- **consistency** - only the correct data/facts gets to be stored in the databse
	- if transaction is **ongoing,** database could be in an **inconsistent state**
## Multi-User Systems
Very few database systems assume to be single user systems 
- In a multi-user system, multiple users/applications need and should be allowed to use the system concurrently. 
	- Unix vs. Session semantics
- It's unrealistic to execute transactions one by one
	- if we could, we could guarantee consistency pretty easily
- How do we execute concurrent processes? 
	- serially 
	- interleaved concurrency 
	- parallel processing (with multiple CPUs) and access data concurrently
## ACID properties:
How could we tell that transaction leaves database in a consistent state?

Traditional database applications usually require **ACID properties** in transaction management: 
- **Atomicity**: all or nothing 
	- transaction can not be partially executed
- **Consistency**: only consistent data in database 
- **Isolation**: as if only one transaction at a time
	- what if other programs using the same database impact my transactions?
	- assume your program is the only one being executed by the DBMS
- **Durability**: committed transactions are forever
	- if you commit transaction, change is there permanently until a new change is made
	- if you rollback transaction, change is not pushed and is gone forever

These are very rigid properties that the system needs to maintain

Note: Newer applications and database models (such as NoSQL) usually are developed for less rigid situations, and sometimes favour more flexible (looser) transaction management properties: 
- Basic Availability.
	- don't want to shut down the site to make updates
- Soft State. 
	- changes from newer versions of DBMS don't impact old data that much
- Eventual Consistency.
	- might have multiple copies of database, when a change is made to a copy, want to copy that change to other copies (but not during traffic hours so we maintain availability)
### Transaction Notation
Ri(x) - Ti wants to read x
Wi(x) - Ti wants to write x
Ci - Ti wants to commit
Ai - Ti wants to abort/rollback
Generally: Oi(x) - Ti wants to operate on x
## Anomalies due to Interleaved Execution
### Reading dirty data (write-read conflicts)
- **Dirty data** - data that has been updated but not committed
- ![[Pasted image 20250320135037.png]]
	- what's inside of X is dirty data:
### Unrepeatable reads (read-write Conflicts
- ![[Pasted image 20250320135659.png]]
	- Transaction 1 is transferring money from account X to account Y
	- In the middle of the transaction, transaction 2 is trying to find the total asset worth (account X + account Y).
	- This is done before transaction 1 has finished transferring the money, so the data from transaction 2 is bad.
### Lost updates (write-write conflicts)
- ![[Pasted image 20250320140009.png]]
- Transaction 1 finishes later than transaction 2, so it overwrites the write that happened in transaction 2, since both are writing to account X
