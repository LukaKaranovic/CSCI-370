# Scheduling General Process
![[Pasted image 20250325135413.png]]
- scheduler takes read/write requests from transactions 
- for each request, takes one of the following actions:
	- execute 
	- delay 
	- ignore 
	- reject 
- the output from the scheduler is called a **schedule.** 
- Scheduler should not need to understand the transaction semantics. The conventional assumption for the scheduler is: 
	- Any database element that a transaction T writes is given a value that depends on the database state in such a way that no arithmetic coincidences occur.
### Reminder: Transaction Notation
Ri(x) - Ti wants to read x
Wi(x) - Ti wants to write x
Ci - Ti wants to commit
Ai - Ti wants to abort/rollback
Generally: Oi(x) - Ti wants to operate on x
## Scheduler Correctness
With scheduling we care about two things:
1. **Correctness** - Is a schedule correct?
	- When a database server processes several concurrent transactions, it **must appear** as if the **transactions have been executed sequentially** (in some/any order). 
	- If a database server really **processes those transactions sequentially,** the generated schedule is called a **serial schedule**. A serial schedule **must be correct.** 
	- If transaction Ti appears to **precede Tj**, then it means that Tj **will “see”** all the updates done by Ti, and Ti **will not see** any updates done by Tj. 
2. Protocols to be used by scheduler so that it generates schedules that are correct
	- Will be covered in [[18. TM - Scheduler Protocols]].

Serial scheduling is **always correct**.
- Order of operations within transaction matters
* Order of transactions doesn't matter
* Isolation matters
Serial scheduling:
- If T1 starts first, then T2 starts after. Schedule says "I will **completely finish** and commit/rollback T1 **before starting T2**"
- Puts transactions into a queue.
- However, throughput isn't good
## Scheduling Theorems
Schedule S1 is **equivalent** to S2 if computationally S1 and S2 produce the same result on any and all database instances.
- S1 and S2 are equivalent if and only if **every pair of conflict operations** are ordered the same way in both schedules.

If a schedule S is **equivalent** to a serial schedule SS, then S must be **correct.**
- If S is equivalent to any serial schedule, the S1 is a **conflict serializable** schedule.

**If two schedules are equivalent, they are equivalent on any database instances.**
- Note: think about the database instances as test cases.
- The same principle holds for queries. If a query is right, it will return the right data on any database instances. 

A pair of **conflict operations:** exist if they
- belong to **different transactions**
- access the **same database object**
- at least one of the operations is a **write operation**

Two schedules are **conflict equivalent** if every pair of conflicting operations are ordered the same way in both schedules. 
## Conflict Serializability
If a schedule is **conflict equivalent** to a **serial schedule,** then the schedule is a **conflict serializable schedule.**  
- A conflict serializable schedule is guaranteed to preserve computational effects.  

We use serialization (precedence) graphs to test whether a schedule is conflict serializable.
- **A serialization (Precedence) graph SG(S)** for a schedule S is a **directed graph with nodes labeled by transactions**, and an **edge from Ti to Tj** is in SG(S) if and only if **Oi\[x] precedes Oj\[x] in S** where Oi\[x] and Oj\[x] **are conflicting operations.**  

Consider S and its corresponding serialization graph G:
- S is **conflict serializable** if and only if **G is acyclic.**

## Examples (Conflict Serializable)
S: R1(x) R2(y) R1(y) R2(z) R3(y) W3(z) W2(x) R1(z) 
- x: R1 W2
	- R1 W2 is a pair of conflict operations
- y: R2 R1 R3
- z: R2 W3 R1
	- R2 W3 and W3 R1 are pairs of conflict operations

- This is a **cyclic graph**, the schedule **is not** conflict serializable
 
S: R1(x) R1(y) W1(x) R2(x) R3(y) R1(z) W3(y) W1(z) W2(x)

- x: R1 W1 R2 W2 
	- R1 W2 is a pair of conflict operations
	- W1 R2 is a pair of conflict operations
- y: R1 R3 W3 
	- R1 W3 is a pair of conflict operations
- z: R1 W1
![[Pasted image 20250404131041.png]]
- This is an **acyclic graph,** the schedule **is** conflict serializable
- Conflict equivalent to both the serial schedules T1T2T3 and T1T3T2.
	- These are obtained from following the directed graph. Start at T1 and then can choose either T2 or T3 next.

## Other Schedule Properties
Conflict serializable schedules say nothing about **how each transaction in the schedule would terminate itself.**
### Recoverable Schedules
 A schedule is recoverable if each transaction commits only **after** each transaction from which it has **read data has committed.**  
 - E means either Commit or Abort: 
### Cascadeless Schedules
 A schedule **avoids cascading rollback** if transactions may read only values **written by committed transactions** (no reading dirty data).
### Example
 Recoverable schedule S: R1(x) R1(y) W1(x) R2(x) R3(y) R1(z) W3(y) W1(z) W2(x) E1 E3 E2
 - Order of E2 and E3 doesn't matter (we determined from above example that sequence can be either T1 T2 T3 or T1 T3 T2).
 - If T1 decides to abort, then T2 must abort itself too because T2 read the dirty data (x) that should be there (written by T1)

Cascadeless schedule S: R1(x) R1(y) W1(x) R2(x) R3(y) R1(z) W3(y) W1(z) E1 W2(x) E3 E2
- If T1 **commits**, then T2 would read the **x value written by T1** (a committed transaction). 
- If T1 **aborts**, then T2 would read the **original x value** (before touched by T1).
- Either way, T2 can decide to **commit or abort** without ever considering how T1 ended itself.

### Recoverable GPT
A **recoverable schedule** makes sure that:
> If one transaction uses data written by another, it will **wait to commit** until the one it depends on commits.

### Why is this important?
Imagine this:

- **T1 writes a value**, and then
- **T2 reads that value**, and then
- **T1 crashes (never commits)**...

Now **T2 has read data from a transaction that failed**, which could make the database **inconsistent**.
