#### Major application focuses of computers:
* Computing (not considered in this course)
* Storing data (creating new data)
* Retrieving data (viewing existing data)
* Manipulating data (processing/updating existing data)
#### Difference between data and information:
**Data** is raw facts and figures, it has no specific function and has no meaning on its own.
* For more, see the top section of: [[2. Data Models]].

**Information** is data that has been processed, organized, and structured. It gives context for the facts and facilitates decision making.

Example:
* Data - student test scores
* Information - class average score on test (information derived from student test scores)
# How we usually deal with data (main pros/cons):
1. Make data structures in programs to store data
   Pros:
	* Can access data really quickly
   Cons:
	* Once program is terminated (voluntarily or involuntarily), all data is gone
	* Need to learn so many data structures and their associated operations
2. Store data in files
   Pros:
	* Data won't be gone when program is terminated, only if file is deleted
   Cons: 
	* Once file is open to read/write, no other sources can open that file (no concurrent access to data)
	* Order of attributes in data matters when put into files (difficult to maintain consistent data)
	* Data format depends on the individual programs (or programmers)
	* Hard to have enforced data integrity (security problems)
	* Redundant storage, as independent copies must be made. This leads to inconsistent copies and expensive updates
	* Added complexity of data recovery
3. Using relational database systems
   Pros:
	* Database Management System (DBMS) is only concerned with data, not information (which is application independent)
	* Data is consistently formatted
	* Concentrates all data into one place so multiple users and applications can use it (concurrent access to data)
	* Data is important and stored reliably and securely (crash recovery)
	* Large amounts of data is stored in mass (secondary storage), and data is able to be retrieved/manipulated efficiently from that storage

# What is a Database Management System (DBMS)?
It is a software program designed to assist in maintaining and manipulating large collections of data.
**Objective:** to isolate application programs as much as possible from changes to data and to descriptions of data.
## Basic Ideas used by DBMS
* Remove details related to data storage and access from application programs
* Concentrate those functions in a single sub-system: DBMS
* Have all applications access data through the DBMS (instead of having multiple small databases and mapping one to each application, what if we had one big database holding all overlapping data that several applications need)
## What has been achieved using DBMS?
* Data can be shared easily
* Redundancy can be reduced
* Inconsistency can be avoided
* Transaction can be provided
* Integrity can be maintained
* Security can be enforced
* Backup and recovery can be done
* Conflicting requirements can be balanced
* Reduced application development time
## Applications of Database Technology
1. Inventory control - Keeps track of the inventory stock for each item, item names, and item locations.
2. Payroll - Keeps track of who has been paid, how much people need to be paid, when to pay people.
3. Digital library systems - Keeps track of and organizes book information (titles, location, author, if it's taken out or not, number of copies)
4. Reservation systems - Keeps track of and organizes booking data.
5. Banking records - Keeping track of bank account details, personal information, security questions, etc.
6. Hospital, university, government - Keeping track of patient/student/citizen data and personal information.

Database Management Systems are the back-end of almost every online business nowadays. User data is valuable and essential to running a business.
