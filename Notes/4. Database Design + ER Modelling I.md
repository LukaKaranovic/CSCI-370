# Semantic Modelling
* Why not use the relational schema directly?
	* Relational model has only one concept - relations
	* Real world situations usually have several concepts

* Real world ideas (description in natural languages)
	* High-Level Design (semantic models)
	* Conceptual Relational Database Schema (relations)
	* Physical Schema in a Relational DBMS (SQL DDL statements to actually create tables)

**What could we use for semantic modelling?**
* Entity-Relationship (ER) Models or ER Diagrams
* UML (Unified Modelling Language)

Drawing of the semantic modelling process
## ER Models
* ER modelling is one of the most widely used semantic modelling approaches.
* The visualization of ER modelling is an ER diagram
* There are three principle element types:
	* Entity sets
	* Properties (or attributes)
	* Relationship sets

### ER Diagram Example

## Entity Sets
* Strong (regular) entity sets
* Weak entity sets
* Existence Dependencies
	* Weak (subordinate) entity's existence depends on dominant entity
* A weak entity set must have a many-to-one relationship set to a regular entity set.
* We don't care about just one entity, we care about the set of entities and set of relationships

### Example with weak entity sets:

## Attributes
* Attributes describe entity sets (adjectives) and/or relationship sets (adverbs)
* Special attributes:
	* **Identifier** of a strong entity set: A special set of attributes selected by the designer to **uniquely identify** the entities in the entity set.
	* **Discriminator** of a weak entity set: A set of attributes that **distinguish subordinate entities** in a weak entity set, for a particular dominant entity.
* Typically, the identifier of a weak entity set consists of 
	* The discriminator of the weak entity set 
	* The identifier of the entity set for dominating entities
## Relationship Sets
* Usually, relationship sets are binary ones.
* Roles in relationships - if a relationship involves two entities from the same entity set, different role names are given to these two entities.
* Design goal is to have binary relationships and no higher (no multiway relationship sets).

#### Cardinalities
The cardinality of a relationship set is the number of times an entity in one set participates in a relationship with an entity in another set.
* Describes how data in two tables is related.
General cardinality constraints can be applied to relationship sets in ER diagrams.
Multi-way relationship sets are usually converted to multiple binary ones using **aggregation**.

* Types of relationship sets according to the cardinality of the relationship set:
	* **One-to-one:** One entity is related to exactly one entity in another set.
		* A driver has one license.
	* **One-to-many** One entity is related to multiple entities in another set.
		* A customer can place multiple orders at a restaurant.
	* **Many-to-many:** Multiple entities in one set are related to multiple entities in another set.
		* A student can take multiple classes, and a class can have multiple students

## Design Principles
* Be faithful to the specifications of the application.
* Avoid redundancy, say everything once only.
* Choose the right relationships.
* Pick the right elements.
* If something can't be modelled exactly, it is preferable to be under-constrained rather than over-constrained.
