Why do we want to make an application to help access data instead of writing queries?
1. SQL is not Turing-complete language (on purpose)
	- Can not implement every task that can be done by an algorithm
2. SQL can't do or handle recursion
Solution: Use SQL in conjunction with a general-purpose programming language, also called the **host language.**

How can it be done?
- Embedded SQL
- Library calls (CLI – Call Level Interface)
- ODBC/JDBC (still use library calls, but ... )
## Three-Tier Architecture
Databases can run as small, standalone programs.
- However, when a large database is used, a very common architecture is called the **three tier/layer architecture.**

**Web-Server Tier:** web server processes manage the interactions with users, collecting requests and presenting the responses.
**Application Tier:** invoked by web-server process to perform the business logic, deciding what kind of data to retrieve in response to the request, forming the proper query
**Database Tier:** execute the queries, return the data.

| (Web-Server) Interface Application | Server Application   | Database Server   |
| ---------------------------------- | -------------------- | ----------------- |
| User I/O                           | Business Logic       | Execute queries   |
| input parameters + command ->      | SQL queries ->       | Dealing with data |
|                                    | <- result projcetion | <- result data    |
## The SQL Environment
A SQL environment is the framework under which data may exist and SQL operations on data may be executed.
- It contains a collection of catalogs, schemas, etc., and most importantly, two special kinds of processes: SQL clients and SQL servers.
- Client and server processes may run on the same machine.
- In order to run a database application program at a host where a SQL client exists, a connection between the client and the server must be opened.
- A connection is like a communication channel between the client and the server.
- Exactly how to establish connection depends on the DBMS and the program method.
- client — request sender (runs the application)
- server — receiver of request (runs the SQL query) 
## Client-Server Architecture
client — request sender (runs the application)
server — receiver of request (runs the SQL query) 

**Client-Side Application Structure**
- various declarations 
- establish connection to database server 
- submit SQL queries to server according to the need
- receive results (if any) back 
- do some further processing of the results (if needed) or process errors 
- commit/rollback 
- disconnect from database server
**Server-Side Process**
- Start the server process
- Wait for client's requests
- Respond to the client's requests
**Client-server communication:**

Note: send request and result data is in a loop until user sends a disconnect request.
## Database Application Types
To make a database application, we need a host language (general-purpose) + SQL

Three main styles:
1. Embedded SQL 
2. Using database library functions (Call Level Interface)
3. ODBC/JDBC
### Embedded SQL
**What is it? - SQL Statements are embedded in a host language.**

Ex. C+SQL language
- C+SQL program compiled into object file by special compiler (provided by database)
- ![[Pasted image 20250304135657.png]]

The application is preprocessed to pure host language program plus library calls. 

**Advantages:** 
- preprocessing of (static) parts of queries 
- various (SQL) checks before running application 
**Disadvantages:** 
- need pre-compiler 
- need to be bound to a database even at compile stage

Strongly recommended to **not** use it.
### Call Level Interface
Definition: a type of **application programming interface (API)** that allows applications to interact with a database management system (DBMS) by sending SQL queries through function/library calls at runtime.
- Enables dynamic SQL execution without the need for pre-compiling the SQL statements within the application code
- Built on library calls instead
- Different database products supply different packages (libraries) 
- Ex. OCCI: Oracle C++ Call Interface

**This method is the focus of this course and the project.**
### JDBC/ODBC
Definition:

**register the driver with DriverManager:**
- Class.forName(driver);
**make connection:**
- Connection con = DriverManager.getConnection(connectString, userid, password);
**get a statement:**
- Statement stmt = con.createStatement(); //or
- stmt = con.prepareStatement(String);
**execute query:**
- int status = stmt.ExecuteUpdate(optional query string);
- ResultSet rs = stmt.ExecuteQuery(optional query string);
**retrieving answer:**
- boolean rs.next()
- XXX rs.getXXX(int/String) // XXX as Int or String
**close all (disconnect):**
- rs.close(); stmt.close(); con.commit(); con.rollback(); con.close();
# OCCI - Oracle C++ Call Interface
**Communication steps:**
1. Establish connection with database
2. Request query execution
3. Read execution result
4. Disconnect from database
## Connections and Environments (Step 1 and 4)
Connect to database:
- All OCCI processing happens in the context of the Environment class. 
- To create an environment: 
	- Environment env = Environment::createEnvironment();
- To terminate an environment: 
	- Environment::terminateEnvironment(env);
- To create a connection: 
	- Connection conn = env->createConnection(userName, password, connectString);
- To terminate a connection: 
	- env->terminateConnection(conn);
- Note that `connectString `indicates where the database server runs
## Prepared vs. Unprepared Statements
In order to submit query, you need to create a statement first. 
- There are two types of statements: 
	- **Unprepared statement:** 
		- Used only when you are executing a query once and never again.
		- Statement stmt = conn->createStatement();
	- **Prepared statement:** 
		- No SQL injections
		- Make query once and reuse it multiple times.
		- Statement stmt = conn->createStatement(queryStringWithParameters);
	- To terminate a statement and clean up the statement space: 
		- conn->terminateStatement(stmt);
## Executing Queries (Step 2)
**Set parameter values:**
- stmt->setInt(index, value); // if value is int type 
- stmt->setString(index, value); // if value is string type 
**Execute update queries and DDL statements:**
- int status = stmt->executeUpdate(); // or 
- int status = stmt->executeUpdate(query); 
**Execute retrieval queries:**
- ResultSet rs = stmt->executeQuery(); // or 
- ResultSet rs = stmt->executeQuery(query); 
**Generic execute (not recommended):**
- stmt->execute(); stmt->execute(query);
## Reading Results (Step 3)
**Get result:**
```c++
// rs starts by pointing just above first tuple
// next() returns true or false based on if there's a next tuple or not.
while (rs->next()) { 
	string name = rs->getString(1); 
	int age = rs->getInt(2); 
}
```
**Commit or Rollback:**
- All queries in a program are considered as 'in a transaction'. 
- To commit or roll back updates early: 
```c++
conn->commit(); // Makes updates permanent.
conn->rollback(); 
stmt->setAutoCommit(true/false);
```
### Execute Query and Read Results Example
```c++
qstr ="";
qstr = qstr + "select name, email " 
			+ "from students "
			+ "where sno not in "
			+ " (select sno "
			+ " from Records)";
ResultSet rs = stmt->executeQuery(qstr);
while (rs->next()) {
	string s1 = rs->getString(1);
	string s2 = rs->getString("email");
	cout << s1 << " " << s2 << endl;
}

// Recommended to convert dates to strings in sql query before using C++ to retrieve results.
```
## SQL Injection
What is it? 
**SQL injection** usually occurs when you ask a user for input, like their username/userid, and instead of a name/id, the user gives you an SQL statement that you will **unknowingly** run on your database.

How to avoid it? 
- unprepared statement + sanitize user input by escaping special characters
- use prepared statement
### Injection Scenario Example
![[Pasted image 20250306141701.png]]
![[Pasted image 20250306141737.png]]
## Examples
```c++
statement *spam = conn->createStatement(qstr);

ResultSet *rs = spam->executeQuery();
qstr = qstr + "update Students "
			+ " set email = :1 "
			+ " where sno = :2";
statement *updateEmail = conn->CreateStatement(qstr);
// Need to pass 4 more params as arguments

cin >> nemail;
updateEmail->setString(1, nemail);
updateEmail->setString(2, "12345");
int rows = updateEmail->executeUpdate();
```

When you aren't going to use ResultSet anymore, use
- stmt->closeResultSet(rs);
- conn->terminateStatement(stmt);
to free memory.

**If you want to sustain multiple result sets simultaneously, you need to have multiple statements, a different one for each result set.**
