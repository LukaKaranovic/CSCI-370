## Levels of Abstraction
* There are two kinds of data independence or abstraction:
	* Physical
	* Logical
* Separation of **view from conceptual schema** enables **logical data independence**
* Separation of **conceptual scheme from physical schema** enables **physical data independence**
## Architecture

## Database Schema
Schema does not contain any data. It is a description of how the data is organized in the database.
* **External Schema:** Views, tailored to specific customer groups
	* Describes data as seen by an application program or by an end user.
* **Conceptual Schema:** entities, relationships, attributes
	* Describes the base logical structure of all data.
* **Internal Schema:** storage organization, index information
	* Describes how the database is physically encoded

## Basics of the Relational Database
* Data is organized in tables/relations
* A table consists of attributes (columns, data fields), and tuples (records, rows)
* A database consists of a collection of tables/relations.
* Schemas
	* Schema of a relation (table schema): Things to describe a relation, including name of the relation and the set of attributes.
	* Schema of a database: A set of the table schema for all the relations in the database.
* Domains: Each attribute (column) of each tuple (row) must be atomic and it should be associated with a domain (collection or range of legal/valid values).

* An instance of a database consists of a collection of true propositions (facts) represented as the data currently stored in the database.
	* Order doesn't matter in a relation (neither vertically or horizontally)
* The interpretation of the data is defined by the schema designers.
* The database itself does not know what the relations and records mean.
* The relations define the truth of relationships between objects without carrying too much about what the objects are.
* Different things are true in different databases.

As a summary, databases store **data, not information**. Users of the databases should interpret the data to **obtain information**. The database schema may give users some hint about **how to interpret the data**.
