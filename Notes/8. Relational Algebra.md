## Query Languages
**Query languages** are programming languages, but not general purpose programming languages.
* They are NOT Turing-complete languages
* Advantages:
	* Easy to learn and simple to use.
	* Leaves the compiler (optimizer) sufficient room to generate highly optimized executable code.
# Relational Algebra
Algebra in general consists of operators and atomic operands.
* An **atomic operand** is a single data value that is treated as an indivisible unit when accessed or modified within a computer program. 
	* This means that any operation performed on it will be completed entirely without interruption from other processes, ensuring data consistency.
* In relational algebra, atomic operands are:
	* **Variables** that stand for relations
	* **Constants**, which are finite relations
* Expressions of relational algebra are usually referred to as **queries**.
* Relational algebra uses set semantics (a relation is a set of tuples and duplicates are remove automatically in the result relation)
	* Duplicates are removed as a set contains only unique elements.
* Uses set semantics (no duplicat4es is assumed).

**Operands: tables/relations**
## Operations:
Types of operations:
* Set operations
* Operations that remove parts of a relation
* Operations that combine the tuples of two relations
* Operations to renaming relations or attributes

* Set Operations (all binary):
	* To apply these operations:
		* Both relations must be **union compatible**
			* Same number of columns and the corresponding columns in each relation have the same data type or domain.
		* Must have identical sets of attributes and types for each attribute must be the same.
		* Attributes must be ordered the same way.
	* **Set Union** - Relation_1 ∪ Relation_2 
	* **Set Intersection** - Relation_1 ∩ Relation_2 
	* **Set Difference** - Relation_1 − Relation_2
* Unary Operations
	* **Projection** - π{list of attribute names} (Relation)
	* **Selection** - δ(condition) (Relation)
	* **Renaming** - ρ(A1,A2,...,An) (Relation)
* Binary Operations
	* **Cross-product / Cartesian product** - Relation_1 × Relation_2
	* **Join** - Relation_1 ︎⋈(condition) Relation_2 
		* Combination of cartesian and selection, δ(condition) (Relation_1 × Relation_2)
	* **Natural Join** - Relation_1 ︎︎⋈ Relation_2
		* Combines rows from both tables based on their common columns.
			* All columns from both tables are copied, except:
				* Columns with same name and data type are joined.
				* Rows with matching values are combined into a single result set (duplicates removed).
### More about join
Schema Wise:
* When you join two tables, you get all columns from both tables.
Data Wise:
```
for each tuple tR in Records
	for each tuple tP in Points
		<tR, tP>
		if cond(tR, tP) == true
			<tR, tP> in Result_Table

```
join is same as doing a selection on two tables and doing a cartesian product of the selection
## Algebra Queries
For exams, it is preferred to write relational algebra statements as a visual tree (bottom up) rather than a statement.

Relational algebra is a **functional programming language.**
* Relation(s) in, relations out for all operations.

**Nest operations** - an operation that takes the output of the previous operation as the operand of the next operation.

Expressiveness of a query language
- **Relational completeness:** The capability of forming arbitrarily complex queries to access database data without using either iteration or recursion.

### Example
For each employee who works in a department managed by Mary Smith, list his/her first and last name and the department’s name. 
```
P_{firstname, lastname, dname} (  
	P_{did,dname}(     
		S_(firstname=‘Mary’ and lastname=‘Smith’)Emps    
			J_(eid=managerid) Departments))
		J_(did = workdept) Emps)
```
