## I/O model of computation 
What’s wrong with memory? - It is volatile.

Typical storage hierarchy: 
- Main memory for currently used data 
- Disk for the main database 
- Tapes for archiving older versions of the data  

**DBMS assumes the Dominance of I/O cost**: The time taken to perform a disk access is much larger than the time likely to be used manipulating that data in main memory. Thus, **the number of block accesses (Disk I/O’s) is a good approximation to the time needed by the algorithm** and should be minimized. 

In analysis, we also assume the **worst case scenario: 100 percent miss rate**

## Buffer Management in DBMS 
Similar to paging/buffer management in OS
Why not let OS manage the buffer? 
- portability issues
- extra requirements from DBMS
	- e.g., to maintain the write ahead log, we may need to force write some pages and be aware which transaction is accessing which page. 
- we may want to adjust the replacement policy and pre-fetch pages based on access patterns in typical DB operations.

## Data on Disk 
**Record (tuple) format:** 
- Fixed Length 
- Variable Length 
	- sentinel end-of-record character
	- length/pointer at the beginning of the record 
**Page (4k bytes) format:**
- as an array of records 
- as an array of pointers
**Table/Relation** 
- Files of Data Pages

## How to access data?
Table scan 
Using index 
Example: 
- 10,000 students each student record occupies about 250 bytes
- each data page is 4k bytes 
- each data page can store about 16 records 
- it takes 640 data pages to store the 10,000 student records
### Why do we need to use indices?
For a SQL query: `select * from Students where sno = ’123456789’;`

From example above:
**Table scan I/O cost**: N blocks (640 pages) 
**Binary search I/O cost**: log<sub>2</sub>N = log<sub>2</sub>640 ~= about 9 to 10 
- However, need about 640 nodes to construct the binary search tree

### Index Types 
**B+/B tree:** widely used, fully dynamic, and support range queries 
**Hash Tables** 
**R-Trees, KD Trees** 
**ISAM (old, static)**
and more
