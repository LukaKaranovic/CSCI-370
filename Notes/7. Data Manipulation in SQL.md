# Data Manipulation
* **Case insensitive language** (except for literal strings)
* Uses BAG (multiset) semantics
	* Allow duplicates unless explicitly removed
* Correctness:
	* Retrieves all of the qualified data
	* Retrieves nothing but the qualified data
	* Works correctly on ALL possible database instances
* Input of an SQL query: relations
* Output of an SQL query: a relation (likely new)
## Keywords
**SELECT**
* Specifies which columns are to appear in the output.
**FROM**
* Specifies the table or tables to be used.
**WHERE**
* Filters the **rows** subject to some condition expressed as a Boolean expression.
**GROUP BY**
* Forms groups of rows with the same column value.
**HAVING** 
* Filters the groups based on some condition expressed as a Boolean expression.
**ORDER BY**
* Specifies the order of the output.
### Where Condition
* 'where' statement is **optional** in a query.
* Contains a Boolean expression
	* Logical operators: AND, OR, NOT
	* Comparison operators: >, <, >=, <=, =, <>
* Eliminates ambiguity by prefixing the column name with table name.
* Can do string pattern match
	* Operator: like
	* Wild card matching symbols: _ and %
### Join Condition
A join condition defines the way two tables are related in a query by: 
* Specifying the column from each table to be used for the join. 
* A typical join condition specifies a foreign key from one table and its associated key in the other table.
### From List
* Can't appear alone
* Can assign a relation a relation variable.
* All relation variables are distinct, even if they represent the data from the same relation
* Can rename a relation to simplify query writing and to eliminate the ambiguity.
**Example:**
```sql
select C.cid, C.cno, term, R.grade, credits*point as gradepoint
from Records R, Courses C, Points P
where  R.grade = P.grade
and R.cid = C.cid
and R.cno = C.cno
and R.sno = '1234';
```

![[Pasted image 20250131150116.png]]

## Updates
```sql
insert into Students(snum, fname, lname, dob)
values ('123456789', 'John', 'O\'Hare', 
to_date('12/01/2002', dd/mm/yyyy);


update Students set email = 'J.OH@gmail.com'
where snum = '123456789';

-- If you don't include the where statement, all of the tuples in Students table would have their email updated, we don't want that.
```

'where' statements are checked **first** in the query:
```
update Students
set balance = balance * 1.001
where balance >= 1000
```
This statement will check if the balance of a student is >= 1000 **before** the update is done.
* **where statements are Boolean expressions**

For delete statements, it's best practice to replace `delete` with `select *` to check which data in the table is going to be deleted.
```sql
select * from Students
where to_char(dob, 'yyyy') <= '1930';

delete from Students
where to_char(dob, 'yyyy') <= '1930';
```

### Commit and Rollback
Can type `commit` if you are sure you want to make the changes you've made (writes it to hard disk). 

In a SQL session, can type `rollback` to go back to last commit or start of session if no commits were made.
* Used to undo accidental queries/operations
* Can only go back to the **most recent** save state (commit or session start).

## Data Retrieval / Query
**Table Augmented Generation (TAG)** - an AI technique that allows large language models (LLMs) to directly access and interact with structured data like tables within a database

General idea for a query is a question that needs to be answered by the data.

**Process:**
Question in natural language -> SQL query -> DBMS query optimizer -> executable plan in algebra -> executed to retrieve data -> form a table -> table is returned back

TAG uses AI between the **question in natural language** and **SQL query** steps to take a user question and write an equivalent SQL query to retrieve data from the database.
* This way users of database can look stuff up without knowing SQL

## String Patterns and Null Comparisons
Concatenate two data items to be one data item:
`select 'lname ||', '|| fname'`

`= 'John'` 
- Looks for strings that exactly match 'John', no characters before or after
`like '_John'` 
- \_ means exactly 1 character before that place exists, doesn't matter what.
* Looks for strings with only one character before John, and that ends with John.
`like '%John'` 
- % means 0, 1, or many characters before that place can exist.
* Looks for strings ending with John, doesn't matter what's before it.

Since null is neither equal or not equal, we can't use comparison values to check for `null`
* can use `is null` or `is not null`.
## Bigger Queries and Joins

```sql
select C.cid, C.cno, term, R.grade, credits*point as gradepoint
from Records R, Courses C, Points P
where  R.grade = P.grade
and R.cid = C.cid
and R.cno = C.cno
and R.sno = '1234';
```
Note: We can write 'term' instead of 'R.term' because it is the only column in all 3 tables with that name. Same for 'credits' and 'point'.
We call credits * point calculation 'gradepoint'. Like assigning it a variable name.

**Cross-product:**
```sql
select S1.fname and S2.fname
from Students S1,
	 Students S2
where S1.sno > S2.sno
```
* Need to specify we are getting two different instances from Students table (need to differentiate by giving them names).
* Where line is to make sure we don't get same student twice.

**Join:**
```sql
select C.cid, C.cno, term, R.grade, credits*point as gradepoint
from Records R join Courses C on(R.cid = C.cid and R.cno = C.cno)
	join Points P if R.grade = P.grade
where R.sno = '1234';

select cid, cno, term, grade, credits*point as gradepoint
from Records R natural join Courses
	natural join Points
where R.sno = '1234';
```
* **Natural join** is a join but if columns have the same name, naturally they should have the same values.
* For example: In the new table, will only be one 'grade' column, not two. 
	* Which means we don't have to specify R.grade in our select statement anymore.

What does the table look like?
* All columns from 3 tables before select
* After selection, all columns in the select statement
