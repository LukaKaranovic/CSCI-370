## Good DB Design
1. Rule of thumb: Independent facts in separate tables 
2. Each relation schema should consist of a primary key and a set of mutually independent attributes. 
3. Lazy (relaxed) rule: is it in normal form(s)?
## Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF)
Let R be a relation schema and F a set of functional dependencies. 
Schema R is in BCNF if and only if whenever (X → Y) ∈ F<sup>+</sup> and XY ⊆ R, then either 
- (X → Y) is trivial (i.e., Y ⊆ X), or 
- X is a superkey of R. 
A database schema {R1, …, Rn} is in BCNF if each relation schema Ri is in BCNF.

BCNF:
- Formalized the goal that independent facts are stored in separate tables. 
- What should be done if R is not in BCNF? — **Decomposition.**
- Identify undesirable dependencies (the ones that make R not in BCNF), and decompose the schema R using these dependencies.
### Decomposition
Definition: Let R be a relation schema. The collection {R1, . . . , Rn} of relation schemas is a decomposition of R if R = R1 ⋃ R2 ⋃ . . . ⋃ Rn.

A good decomposition:
- does not lose information (most important one) 
- does not complicate checking of constraints
### Lossless-Join Decomposition:
Definition: Suppose R is the Relation Schema (with instance r), and R (r) is decomposed into: R1, R2 (with instance: r1, r2). If r = r1 ⋈ r2, then this decomposition is called a **Lossless-Join Decomposition.** 

How to tell? 
- R1 ∩ R2 → R1 or 
- R1 ∩ R2 → R2

```
// LOSSLESS-JOIN BCNF DECOMPOSITION:
Set ComputeBCNF(R, F) {   
	Result = { R };    
	
	while some Ri in Result and X->Y in F+ violate the BCNF condition    
	// in other words, if X->Y in F+ makes Ri NOT in BCNF    
	
	{    
    Result = Result - {Ri};        
    Add (Ri-(Y-X)) to Result;         
    Add {XY} to Result;    
    } 
    return Result; 
}
```
## BCNF Decomposition
- There is always a lossless-join decomposition. 
- Results depend on sequence of functional dependencies used in the decomposition.

## Dependency Preserving Decomposition
A functional dependency is inter-relational if it requires joining two tables in order to test it. 

A decomposition D = {R1, …, Rn} of R is dependency preserving if there is an equivalent set F’ of FDs, none of which is inter-relational in D. (Note that the assumption here is that none of the functional dependencies in the original set F is inter-relational on original relation R.) 

It is possible that no dependency preserving BCNF decomposition exists. 
- Example: R = {ABC}, and F = {AB → C, C → B}.
## Third Normal Form (3NF)
Let R be a relation schema and F a set of functional dependencies. 

Schema R is in 3NF if and only if whenever (X → Y) ∈ F+ and XY ⊆ R, then one of the following conditions is true: 
- (X → Y) is trivial (i.e., Y ⊆X), or 
- X is a superkey of R, or 
- each attribute of Y is contained in a candidate key of R. 
A database schema {R1, …, Rn} is in 3NF if **each** relation schema Ri is in 3NF.

**3NF Decomposition:**
- 3NF is looser than BCNF (it allows more redundancy)
- For any relation, there always exists a lossless-join, dependency-preserving decomposition into 3NF relation schema.
### Minimal Cover
A set of functional dependencies G is minimal if:
- every right-hand side of an FD in G is a single attribute. 
- for no X → A in G is the set (G − {X → A}) equivalent to G. 
- for no X → A in G and Z ⊂ X is the set (G − {X → A}) ∪ {Z → A} equivalent to G. 

For every set of FDs F, there is an equivalent minimal set of FDs (called the minimal cover of F).
G is the minimal cover of F if G is equivalent to F and G is minimal.

**Finding Minimal Cover:** Goal is to get rid of redundancy in functional dependency set.
1. Replace X →YZ with the pair X → Y and X → Z. 
2. For all X -> A in F, if F - {X -> A} = F, then remove X -> A
	- Remove X → A from F if A ∈ ComputeXClosure(X, F - {X → A}). 
3. For all X -> A, if F - {X -> A} U {X - B -> A} = F, then F = F - {X -> A} U {X - B -> A}
	- Remove A from the left-hand-side of X → B in F if B ∈ ComputeXClosure(X − {A}, F ).

```
// compute the minimal cover of F, each functional dependency forms a relation 
// in the decomposed set; If the candidate key is missing, add it to the decomposition 
Set Compute3NF(R, F) {    
	Result = { }; // empty set of Result to start with    
	
	G = a minimal cover for F;    
	for each (X->Y) in G {        
		Add {XY} to Result;    
	}    
	if none of Ri in Result contains a candidate key of R {        
		compute a candidate key K of R;        
		Add K to Result;    
	}     
	return Result; 
}
```

## Summary 
Normal forms are a way to assess a database's design/integrity, with first normal form (1NF) being the lowest, and 5NF being the highest.
- For a table to comply with a normal form, it must comply with all the lower normal forms as well.
### 1NF Rules:
1. Using **row order to convey information** is not permitted.
2. **Mixing data types within the same column** is not permitted.
3. Having a **table without a primary key** is not permitted.
4. **Repeating groups** are not permitted. 
	- Having one row with each item in it for an entire player's inventory is bad.
	- Instead, make a table with the columns {player_id, item_name, quantity} and store an entry for each item a player has.
### 2NF Rules:
1. Each **non-key attribute** must depend on the **entire primary key.**
### 3NF Rules:
1. Every **non-key attribute** in a table should depend on **the key, the whole key, and nothing but the key.**
	- This is a direct extension of 2NF.
### BCNF Rules:
- Can change this by removing 'non-key' to get **Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF):**
	- "Every **attribute** in a table should depend on **the key, the whole key, and nothing but the key.**"

Consider this table:
![[Pasted image 20250316105903.png]]

![[Pasted image 20250316105851.png]]
We notice that this FD exists, where player_rating, a non-key attribute, depends on something other than the key (player_skill_level).

Instead, we should make a new table to avoid this problem, so we don't get data inconsistencies:
![[Pasted image 20250316105924.png]]
### 4NF Rules:
1. **Multivalued dependencies** in a table must be multivalued dependencies **on the key.**

**Multivalued dependency** - for a single value of attribute ‘a’, multiple values of attribute ‘b’ exist. We write it as, a -->> b
Example:
![[Pasted image 20250316110807.png]]
This table is **not in 4NF**, as model itself is not the key.

Instead, we should make two tables:
![[Pasted image 20250316111120.png]]
### 5NF Rules:
1. The table (which must be in 4NF) cannot be **describable** as the logical result of **joining some other tables together.**
