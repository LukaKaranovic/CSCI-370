**Practical DB Design:**
- Data Description
- ER Diagrams 
- Relational Conceptual Schema
**Theoretical DB Design:**
- Functional Dependency
- Normal Forms
- Legacy data collection and some domain knowledge
	- .csv files, .json, etc.
	- We don't like
		- that they have a lot of redundancy -> leads to inconsistency -> db has errors and doesn't present reliable/meaningful data
	- how do we decide if that spreadsheet is good enough to directly bulk insert into a database? 
		- functional dependency

How to judge if a schema is good or not?
- no redundant data
- easy to query
- easy to update
- only allows well-behaved instances
- any concrete theory basis? yes:
# Functional Dependency
## Definition/Proof
Let R be a relational schema,
and X, Y is a subset of R
where X, Y and R are sets of attributes
Functional Dependency X -> Y (X functionally determines Y in R)
holds on R if whenever an instance contains
two tuples, say t1 and t2, such that t1.x = t2.x, then it must be true that t1.y = t2.y

**Examples:**
- {Sno} → {Name}, or Sno → Name 
- Cno → Title 
- {Sno, Cno, Term} → {Grade}, or Sno, Cno, Term → Grade

**Where do FDs come from?**
- From domain knowledge
- From inference
## Examples 
{Sno} → {Name} or Sno → Name 
Cno → Title 
{Sno, Cno, Term} → {Grade}, or Sno, Cno, Term → Grade

**Trivial FDs:** If Y is a subset of X, X -> Y must hold on all of R's instances.
- Sno -> Sno
## Reasoning about FDs
Armstrong’s Axioms (X, Y, Z are all sets of attributes)
- **Reflexivity:** Y ⊆ X => X → Y (trivial functional dependency) 
- **Augmentation:** X → Y => XZ → YZ 
- **Transitivity:** X → Y, Y → Z => X → Z 
Additional rules can be derived:
- **Union:** X → Y, X → Z => X → YZ 
- **Decomposition:** X → YZ => X → Y and X → Z
## Implications about FDs
 **Closure of F** - the set of **all functional dependencies** that can be logically derived from a given set of functional dependencies, F, **using Armstrong's axioms.**
- Denoted as F<sup>+</sup>: R |= F `<=>` R |= F<sup>+</sup>

Relation schema R satisfies **all the functional dependencies in the set F** if and only if relation schema R satisfies **all the functional dependencies in the set of F closure.** 

In other words, all the functional dependencies in the set F hold on relation R if and only if all the functional dependencies in the set F closure hold on relation R. 
the axiom is 
- sound 
- complete
## Keys
**Superkey:** K ⊆ R is a superkey for R if functional dependency K → R holds on R. 

**Candidate key:** K ⊆ R is a candidate key for R if 
- K is a superkey of R 
- and no subset of K is a superkey. 
	- for any attribute A in K, K - {A} is not a super key of R

**Primary key:** a candidate key chosen by the database designer(s)

## Efficient Reasoning
Given a relational R (a set of attributes) and a set of functional dependencies F.
Set ComputeXClosure(x, F)
- x is a set of attributes
- Return a set of attributes such that all attributes is functional determined by X
```cpp
// return the set of attributes,
// each attribute in the set is functionally determined by X
Set ComputeXClosure(X, F) {
// X: a set of attributes, F: a set of FD
    Set XC = X; // XC: a set of attributes
                // X -> XC (trivial because XC is X)
    bool reachClosure = false; // closure flag
    while (!reachClosure) {
       reachClosure = true;
       for (each (Y -> Z) in set F) {
           if Y is subset of XC, and Z is not a subset of XC {
              // X -> XC (invariant)
              // XC -> Y (trivial because Y is a sebset of XC)
              // Y -> Z (it's given because it's in set F)
              XC = XC union Z; // X -> XC, XC -> Y, Y -> Z => X -> Z
              reachClosure = false; // just added some new attribute to XC
           }
       }
   }
   return XC;
}
```
Then if we want to check: is it true that X -> A?
- Check: is it true that A is in ComputeXClosure(x, F)?

Is K a super key of R (given F)?
- is it true that R is a subset of ComputeXClosure(K, F)?

Is K a candidate key of R (given F)?
- is K a super key of R? 
- if yes:
	- for each element A in K, is R a subset of ComputeXClosure(K, F)?
	- answer should be no for all A

F ≡ G ⇔ F+ = G+ 
- (Functional dependency set F is equivalent to set G if and only if F closure is identical as G closure.) 
## Summary / Rules of FD
Armstrong’s Axioms (X, Y, Z are all sets of attributes)
- **Reflexivity:** Y ⊆ X => X → Y (trivial functional dependency) 
- **Augmentation:** X → Y => XZ → YZ 
- **Transitivity:** X → Y, Y → Z => X → Z 
Additional rules can be derived:
- **Union:** X → Y, X → Z => X → YZ 
- **Decomposition:** X → YZ => X → Y and X → Z

1. If two determinants are **different** and their dependents are **different**, this is a **valid FD.**
2. If two determinants are **the same** and their dependents are **the same**, this is a **valid FD.**
3. If two determinants are **different**, but their dependents are **the same**, this is a **valid FD.**
4. If two determinants are **the same**, but their dependents are **different**, this is an **invalid FD.**
