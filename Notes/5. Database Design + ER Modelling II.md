## Extensions to ER Model
* Structured attributes
	* Break an attribute into “sub-attributes”. 
	* Ex. break down an **address** of a student into sub-attributes such as **street name, province, postal code, etc.**

* **Aggregation** - Treating a relationship set as an entity set in other relationships
	* If you need to treat a relationship as an entity, Put a rectangle over the relationship and that is aggregation.

Sellers selling the products are treated as an entity in the relationship set of purchasing a product, rather than sellers being directly involved in the purchase.

* **Specialization** - subclasses
	* If entity set A is a specialization of entity set B: 
		* Every entity in A is also an entity in B,
		* Some entities in B are not in entity set A
![[Pasted image 20250119140159.png]]**Discounted products** and **out-of-stock products** are specializations of **products**.
* Products could be discounted or out-of-stock, but not all products fall into these two categories.
* **Generalization** - subclasses
	* If entity set A is a generalization of entity set B and entity set C:
		* Every entity in A is either in entity set B or in entity set C

Here, **contractors** is a generalization of **hourly contractors** and **project contractors**.
* This means contractors are either hourly contractors or project contractors, there are no other options.
## ER Model to Relational Schema
* Strong entity set - relation with all attributes
* Weak entity set - relation with all attributes and the identifier from the dependent strong entity set
### Relationship Sets
* Relationship sets
	* **Many-to-many** - relation with the identifiers from both participating entity sets and the attributes of the relationship set
	* **Many-to-one** - extend the relation corresponding to the entity set that participates many times in the relationship set to also include the identifier of the other entity set and the attributes of the relationship set.
	* **One-to-one** - same as many-to-one relationship sets.
In summary, many-to-many relationship sets have their own relations, while many-to-one and one-to-one relationship sets don't. Instead, they extend off of the corresponding entity set's relation, including the other entity's identifier and the relationship's attributes.
### Helpful Notes
* Weak relationship sets are always many-to-one
* Many-to-many relationship sets need to have its own table
* Many-to-one relationship set doesn't deserve to have its own table
	* Add one column to the 'many' side (entity) table of relationship set
	* add any attributes of the relationship set to that table too, and the other entity set's identifier

**Primary key constraint** - way to uniquely identify each record in table
**Foreign key constraint** - value must have appeared in other table's primary key column
* references that other table's primary key column
* creates a connection between entities
**There are null values in databases - similar to "we don't know", it is neither equal to or not equal to**

**Scarce table** - big table where there are lots of null values 
### What we want in relational schema:
Table names(attribute names)
\+ constraints

Translating ER diagram to relational schema
1. Entity Sets -> Tables
	* All attributes of that entity set gets added to this table.
	* **Example:** Students(snum, name, email, dob)
	* **Identifier** of entity set becomes **primary key** of the table - underline it.
		* Two tuples in same table cannot have same primary key.
	* **Specialized entities** inherit identifiers from parent
	* **Weak entities** must have identifier from strong entity set and discriminator from its own set.
	* Both identifier and discriminator are the primary key of this entity set.
		* Identifier would be a **foreign key** as it is referencing another table to check if it exists.
2. Relationship Sets -> Tables
	* weak relationship sets are always many-to-one
	* many to one relationship set doesn't deserve to have its own table
	* add one column to the 'many' side (entity) table of relationship set
		* add any attributes of the relationship set to that table too
	* many to many relationship sets need to have its own table
		* Primary key should take primary keys from all connected entity sets. Each primary key from an entity set is a foreign key referencing that entity set table.
