a. For each active member (whose status is 'Active'), list their contact name and email, and the order number and package type of their latest placed order 
(whose place time is the largest).

OldestActiveOrder(name, email, orderNum, packageType) ::= MemberAccounts(accnum, name, email, _, _, _, 'Active')
                                                        and Orders(orderNum, accnum, placeTime, packageType, _, _, _, _)
                                                        and NOT (Orders(orderNum2, accnum, placeTime2, _, _, _, _)
                                                        and placetime2 > placeTime)

b. List the contact name, email and farm address of each producer who is capable of supply EVERY food item. A producer is considered to be able to supply every 
food item if this producer had supplied every food item in the FoodItems table before.

BadProducers(accnum) ::= MemberAccounts(accnum, name, email, _, _, _, _)
                         and Producers(accnum, farmAddress)
                         and FoodItems(pc, _, _)
                         and NOT SupplyRecords(accnum, pc, _, _)

GoodProducers(name, email, farmAddress) ::= MemberAccounts(accnum, name, email, _, _, _, _)
                                        and Producers(accnum, farmAddress)
                                        and NOT BadProducers(accnum)
