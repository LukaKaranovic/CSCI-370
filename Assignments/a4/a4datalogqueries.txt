1. For each loyal member who had placed at least one order, list the member's contact name and delivery address.
There shouldn't be any duplicates in the result.
Extra information: A loyal member is defined as someone who has never cancelled their membership with the Food Sharing Program. 
In other words, their status is still 'Active' and their sign up date and activation date remain the same.

LoyalMember(contactName, deliveryAddress) ::= MemberAccounts(accnum, contactName, _, deliveryAddress, date, date, 'Active')
                                              and Orders(_, accnum, _, _, _, _, _, _)

2. For each order that received (and accepted presumably because the data is in the database now) a wrong sized package 
(i.e., the package size demanded by the order is different from the size of the package delivered), list the contact name and delivery address of the member who 
placed the order, and the delivered package's batch barcode and package size, and the delivery date.

WrongDelivery(contactName, deliveryAddress, barcode, sizeType, deliverTime) ::= MemberAccounts(accnum, contactName, _, deliveryAddress, _, _, _)
                                                                                and Orders(_, accnum, _, packageType, _, deliverTime, barcode, _)
                                                                                and Batches(barcode, _, sizeType)
                                                                                and sizeType != packageType and deliverTime is not null

3. List the contact name, email and delivery address of each member whose status is 'Active' now, but who never placed any order in year 2024.
There shouldn't be any duplicates in the result.

Helper subquery:
OrderedIn2024(_, accnum, _, _, _, _, _, _) ::= MemberAccounts(accnum, _, _, _, _, _, 'Active')
                                               and Orders(_, accnum, placeTime, _, _, _, _, _) 
                                               and placeTime >= '01-Jan-24' and placeTime <= '31-Dec-24'

No2024Orders(contactName, email, deliveryAddress) ::= MemberAccounts(accnum, contactName, email, deliveryAddress, _, _, 'Active'),
                                                      NOT (OrderedIn2024(accnum))

4. List the contact name, email and farm address of each producer who supplied some food item that's not broccoli to the Food Sharing Program in 2024. 
Broccoli's name is stored as 'Broccoli' in FoodItems table. There shouldn't be any duplicates in the result.

NonBroccoliSupplier(contactName, email, farmAddress) ::= Producers(accnum, farmAddress)
                                                         and MemberAccounts(accnum, contactName, email, _, _, _, _)
                                                         and SupplyRecords(accnum, productCode, supplyDate, _)
                                                         and supplyDate >= '01-Jan-24' and supplyDate <= '31-Dec-24'
                                                         and NOT (FoodItems(productCode, 'Broccoli', _))

5. List the contact name, email and farm address of each producer who never supplied any broccoli to the Food Sharing Program in 2024. Broccoli's name 
is stored as 'Broccoli' in FoodItems table.

Helper subquery:
BroccoliSupplied2024(accnum) ::= Producers(accnum, _)
                            and SupplyRecords(accnum, productCode, supplyDate, _)
                            and FoodItems(productCode, 'Broccoli', _)
                            and supplyDate >= '01-Jan-24' and supplyDate <= '31-Dec-24'

NonBroccoliSupplier(contactName, email, farmAddress) ::= Producers(accnum, farmAddress)
                                                         and MemberAccounts(accnum, contactName, email, _, _, _, _)
                                                         and NOT (BroccoliSupplied2024(accnum))
